## The next steps to improve the application: 

* The application is only tested using Chrome, so there might some styling issues when using other navigators. <br/>

* The openweathermap.org offers an insecure access (HTTP) that contradicts with the github pages security (HTTPS) (you need to disable the Insecure parameter to allow in the settings or update the account to an Entreprise one on openweathermap.org). <br/>

* Use a geocoder in order to get the city's name and country from the geographical coordinates when clicking on the map.<br/>

* Modify the description part of the forecats in order to get more precise information(+CSS).<br/>

* Improve the design of the application. <br/>
